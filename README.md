# DroneDeploy App Documentation

Since 2015, tens of thousands of DroneDeploy users have mapped more than 8 million acres in various different industries. Our API allows outside developers to build new products and services on top of DroneDeploy as apps.

Once a user installs an app it will be run on DroneDeploy.com, DroneDeploy on Android and DroneDeploy on iOS. All apps are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Apps have the capability to access and modify DroneDeploy features. Additionally, any JavaScript framework or library can be used while developing an app.
