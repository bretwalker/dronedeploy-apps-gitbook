# DroneDeploy App SDK BETA signup

Dear DroneDeploy Developer,

With over **70 apps** on the App Market ranging from requesting flights on demand to counting plants, it is clear that our developers are incredibly creative and continue to push the boundaries of what apps can do on the DroneDeploy platform.


At DroneDeploy we are committed to our developers and want to give you the tools necessary to build what you want. That is why we are excited to announce the next generation of DroneDeploy’s App Platform, with 3 innovative platform features: 

* [**Datastore**](datastore.md): create custom tables to store data however you want

* [**Functions**](functions.md): run your server code securely on DroneDeploy. Don’t worry about hosting ever again

* [**Triggers**](triggers.md): take action on DroneDeploy events like “processing complete” and “export complete” and bring automation to your apps


With these new features we want your ideas to only be bounded by your imagination.

We couldn’t do it without our developer community and cannot wait to get these new tools in your hands.
